## My personal notes for development;
Core functions can be strengthened and developed.

A user-friendly appearance can be achieved and feature-packed displays can be added to the pages.

Animations and functionalities can be increased.

For later versions, vulnerabilities and usage incentives for cybersecurity tools may be embedded.

The file structure can be updated.

* Always open to joint development.
